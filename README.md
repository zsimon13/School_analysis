# School District Analysis

## Overview
Maria, a school district employee, was working on analysis to understand trends among high schools in the district. After completeing the inintail analyis, it was determined that the 9th grade calss at Thomas High Schoool had unrealiable data due to potential academic dishonesty. In order to make sure that the results of the analyis were not skewed, we were asked to rerun the analysis reaplacing Tyler Highschool's 9th grade class math and reading grades with null values and determine how different it was from the initial analysis.


## Results

As you can see in the figures below, the school district summary did in fact change when Tyler High Schools 9th greade class scores were removed. However the change was not substantial. The "School Summary Original" contains all the data from the original analysis, where the "District School Summary Updated" figure takes the null values into account. The changes are as follows:
- Average Math Score: Dropped by 0.1 points
- Average Reading Score: No change from original data
- Percentage Passing Math: Dropped by 0.2%%
- Percentage Passing Reading: Dropped by 0.3%
- Percentage Passing Overall: Dropped by 0.1%
